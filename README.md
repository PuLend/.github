# PuLend Protocol  
### IP-Collateralized Lending on Story Protocol

PuLend is a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol that allows users to unlock liquidity from their **Intellectual Property (IP)** without selling it.  
Users can borrow stablecoins by depositing IP assets as collateral, while liquidity providers earn yield by supplying liquidity.
